1. **Prepare the Development Environment**:
   - Ensure you have Microsoft Visual Studio installed on your system. This example uses Visual Studio 2022, but you can use an earlier version if needed.
   - Open Visual Studio and create a new solution or open an existing one that contains the WPF project.

2. **Locate the WPF Project**:
   - In the Visual Studio solution explorer, locate the WPF project within your solution.

3. **Compile the WPF Project**:
   - Right-click on the WPF project in the solution explorer and select "Rebuild" or "Build".
   - This will compile the project and generate the necessary output files.
   - Ensure that the compilation process completes successfully without any errors.

4. **Run the WPF Application**:
   - In the Visual Studio toolbar, locate the "Start" button (it typically has a green arrow icon).
   - Click the "Start" button to run the WPF application.
   - Alternatively, you can press the `F5` key or go to the "Debug" menu and select "Start Debugging".
   - Visual Studio will launch the WPF application, and the main window should appear.

5. **Interact with the WPF Application**:
   - You can now interact with the various UI elements and functionality of the WPF application.
   - Test the application's features, such as the `IngredientFilter`, `FoodGroupFilter`, `CaloriesFilter`, `FilterButton`, `AddToMenuButton`, and `RemoveFromMenuButton`.

6. **Debug and Troubleshoot**:
   - If you encounter any issues or errors during the compilation or runtime, you can use the Visual Studio debugger to step through the code and identify the problem.

  1.c=Based on the feedback from my lecturer, I made the following changes to the WPF project:

The main issue identified was that the `InitializeComponent()` method was not being called correctly, which was causing the error. To address this, I modified the `MainWindow` constructor to manually initialize the UI elements instead of relying solely on the automatically generated `InitializeComponent()` method.

I added a new section to the `MainWindow` constructor where I explicitly call `this.InitializeComponent()` to ensure that the UI elements are properly initialized. I also moved the code to load recipes, populate the food group filter, and update the recipe list into this constructor, along with the event handler wiring.

This approach helps guarantee that the UI is set up correctly, regardless of whether the `InitializeComponent()` method is being generated properly. It also allows me to have more control over the initialization process and makes the code more self-contained and easier to understand.

Additionally, I reviewed the rest of the code to ensure that there are no other issues or potential problems. I also added more comments and documentation to improve the overall code quality and maintainability.
